          p.text-left We do not provide credit, refunds, or prorated billing for subscriptions that are cancelled mid-way. In such a circumstance, you will continue to have access to your Subscription until the end of the yearly billing cycle. Each Subscription Provider reserves the right to offer refunds, discounts or other considerations in select circumstances at its sole discretion. Please note that each circumstance is unique and election to make such an offer in one instance does not create the obligation to do so in another.
